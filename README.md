### Structure

View: Jetpack compose function for Android and SwiftUI for iOS.

ViewModel: Android / iOS specific ViewModels act only as a proxy between view and usecase, should not contain login in it.

UseCase: The domain layer; encapsulates the business logic of our app and requests data from the repositories. It is a common code (KMM) for both android and iOS.

Repository: Fetches data either from a remote or local data source and exposes them to our domain layer. It only talks to abstractions so that it wonâ€™t violate the Dependency Inversion Principle. It is a common code (KMM) for both android and iOS.
